## Self-Evaluation

Overall Grade
Grade: 16.5/20
Comments: We are proud of our project, although we are aware some features could be added. If we had more time, we would make sure the comment-section worked properly. We would also enable editing of your own posts. Also weÂ´d give each post an entire-screen display - just like you see in a blog.

Project Structure
Grade: 16/20
Comments: We respected the overall instructions and the frameworks structures. 

Naming Convention
Grade: 15/20
Comments: We tried our best to respect the naming conventions, though we know we made some mistakes.

Front-End (Estetic)
Grade: 18/20
Comments:  We think the website is beautiful and has an even greater potential. WeÂ´re giving ourselves 18/20 because the posts need some work and we could also apply some final touches overall. We spend a lot of time on Tailwind CSS to create a beautiful and dynamic interface.

Back-End 16/20 
Comments: There are some back-end features we didn't manage to implement due to the time constraint.

Final note: Fredrik had some trouble with his GitHub, so he programmed through Aymeric and NicolasÂ´ screen and sent them code through Messenger. His code doesnÂ´t show in the commit history for this reason.
